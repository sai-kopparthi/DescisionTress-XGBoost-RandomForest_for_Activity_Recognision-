# DescisionTress-XGBoost-RandomForest_for_Activity_Recognision

## 1 Data
  
The dataset is taken from UCI Repository named as Heterogeneity Activity Recognition
Data Set. The data is characterized as Multivariate and is used for associated task like
Clustering and classification.
The dataset contains the readings of two motion sensors commonly found in smartphones.
Reading were recorded while users executed activities scripted in no specific
order carrying smartwatches and smartphones.

### 1.1 Goal
We need to recognize the human activities of different user by using Classification and
clustering techniques.

### 1.2 Total Activities
Biking, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Stair Up and Stair down.

# 2 Filtering data
we got the data with 128 features which is not required for the present classification
so firstly for all the below models we filtered the data such that it contains only (4
parameters) sensor outputs and its corresponding output label, and instead of data with
char labels we modify the labels with integers such it√¢AZs flexible for us to do operations
faster. We wrote this code in R programming Language.

# 3 Algorithms
The clustering and classifications strategies used for the above dataset in order to identify
and classify the action performed by the user are:

 Algorithms
| :--------------- |
| K nearest neighbours |
| Logistic Regression |
| XGBoost |
| Random Forest 

# 4 Accuracy's
 Algorithms        |  Avg Accuracy | Avg Time
| :--------------- | :------------: | ---------:|
| K nearest neighbours | 81.15%  | 966.31ms| 
| Logistic Regression | 83.5%  | 312.5ms |
| XGBoost | 86.04% |  7.134ms |
| Random Forest | 82.99% | 8.19ms |
